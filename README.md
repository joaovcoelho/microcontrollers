#### First steps
* 1 - Download and install the proper Arduino IDE for your computer by their official website, which you can find by clicking [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software);
* 2 - Insert the ESP board manager at your Arduino IDE;
* 3 - On the Arduino IDE, open *file>preferences* and paste "https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json" inside "Additional Boards [...]" and press OK at the window;
* 4 - Open up *"tools>board>boards manager"*, type in **esp8266** and install;
* **5 - For inserting libraries**, you can go to *"tools>Manage libraries"* and search for some, or you can add the previously downloaded library file by opening *"sketch>include library>add .ZIP"* and finding your file (or manually at Arduino's Library destination).
